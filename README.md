# Infinite Grimm

Infinite Grimm redefines the Nightmare King Grimm fight in Hollow Knight. Fight NKG a second time in an increasingly difficult endless battle for geo and fun. Many optional challenge modes including NGG and timed modes. How long can you dance with fire?

### Features

* Fight Grimm in an endless, increasingly difficult battle.
* Dance and die and live forever with the rhythmic and cathartic normal difficulty.
* Optional hard difficulty to challenge your muscle memory and push your skill to its limits.
* Earn geo and compliments from Grimm based on the damage done.
* Every attack dodgeable at every speed. No more relying on RNG for your hitless run.*
* Bring Grimmchild with you for moral support and extra damage.
* Leave Grimmchild behind for two extra notches.
* Configure Grimm to your liking. He can fight as slowly or quickly as you wish.
* See your current score at all times. Just look at your geo counter (Thanks to 56 for this)
* Time attack mode - Six minutes (by default) to prove your skills.
* One hit mode to get the adrenaline pumping. Also enables FotF for extra damage.
* Your worst nemesis returns with Infinite Nightmare God Grimms. They're just as you remembered but no downpatch needed.
* Rewrites Hollow Knight lore. Fully compatible with Redwing lore though.


\*Assumes every movement ability unlocked.

### How to install

This mod depends on:

[ModCommon](https://github.com/Kerr1291/ModCommon) by Kerr1291

[Modding API](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding) by Wyza, Firzen, and Seanpr

So first install these from either github or the google drive.

Then download or compile the Infinite Grimm dll from the "tags" section. Or get a prebuilt binary from the google drive as well.

For meaningful progression, it's worth installing this mod alongside [Grimmchild Upgrades](https://gitlab.com/natis1/grimmchildupgrades), which makes your knight's grimmchild stronger the better you do in battle.
