# Infinite Grimm

Infinite Grimm is a hollow knight mod supporting lifeblood. It allows you to fight NKG a second time in an increasingly difficult endless battle for geo and fun. How long can you dance with fire?

### Features

* Fight Grimm in an endless, increasingly difficult battle.
* Optional hard mode for really skilled players.
* Every attack dodgeable at every speed. No more relying on RNG for your hitless run.*
* Bring Grimmchild with you for moral support and extra damage.
* Leave Grimmchild behind for two extra notches.
* Rewrites Hollow Knight lore.


\*Assumes every movement ability unlocked.

### How to install

This mod depends on:

[ModCommon](https://github.com/Kerr1291/ModCommon) by Kerr1291

[Modding API](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding) by Wyza, Firzen, and Seanpr

So first install these from either github or the google drive.
