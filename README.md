# Infinite Grimm

Infinite Grimm is a hollow knight mod supporting lifeblood. It allows you to fight NKG a second time in an increasingly difficult endless battle for geo and fun. How long can you dance with fire?

### How to install

This mod depends on:

[ModCommon](https://github.com/Kerr1291/ModCommon) by Kerr1291

[Modding API](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding) by Wyza, Firzen, and Seanpr

So first install these from either github or the google drive.

Then download or compile the Infinite Grimm dll from the "releases" section.
