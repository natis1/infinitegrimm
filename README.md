# Infinite Grimm

Infinite Grimm is a hollow knight mod supporting lifeblood. It allows you to fight NKG a second time in an increasingly difficult endless battle for geo and fun. How long can you dance with fire?

### Features

* Fight Grimm in an endless, increasingly difficult battle.
* Earn geo and compliments from Grimm based on the damage done.
* Optional hard mode for really skilled players.
* Every attack dodgeable at every speed. No more relying on RNG for your hitless run.*
* Bring Grimmchild with you for moral support and extra damage.
* Leave Grimmchild behind for two extra notches.
* Configure Grimm to your liking. He can fight as slowly or quickly as you wish.
* See your current score at all times. Just look at your geo counter (Thanks to 56 for this)
* Your worst nemesis returns with Infinite Nightmare God Grimms. They're just as you remembered but no downpatch needed.
* Rewrites Hollow Knight lore.


\*Assumes every movement ability unlocked.

### How to install

This mod depends on:

[ModCommon](https://github.com/Kerr1291/ModCommon) by Kerr1291

[Modding API](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding) by Wyza, Firzen, and Seanpr

So first install these from either github or the google drive.

Then download or compile the Infinite Grimm dll from the "releases" section.

For meaningful progression, it's worth installing this mod alongside [Grimmchild Upgrades](https://github.com/natis1/grimmchildupgrades)
